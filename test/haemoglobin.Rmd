## Haemoglobin

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/1GZX_Haemoglobin.png)


#### Key points about this protein:

* Haemoglobin comprises **four globin chains**, each containing a haem molecule which reversibly binds to **oxygen**.

* Binding of oxygen to haem alters oxygen affinity by inducing structural changes in the adjacent globin chains.

* This molecular ‘co-operativity’ within haemoglobin is responsible for a sigmoidal-shaped oxygen dissociation curve and is influenced by pH, carbon dioxide, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

* Haemoglobin forms carbamino compounds with carbon dioxide and buffers hydrogen ions within the erythrocyte, so facilitating the carriage of carbon dioxide in blood.

* Abnormal haemoglobins arise from changes in either the globin chains, the iron atom, or from binding of ligands other than oxygen.
